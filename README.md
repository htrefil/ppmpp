# ppmpp
A simple header-only C++17 library for writing Netbpm images.  
It supports all black and white, grayscale and RGB formats and can serialize images into both binary and textual representations of the format.

## Usage
Put both `image.hpp` and `pixel.hpp` header files in the same directory in your project, then `#include "image.hpp"` and you're ready to go.

## Examples
See the [examples](examples) directory with example programs on how to use the library.
